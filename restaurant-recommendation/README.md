# Polymer Recommendation

## This program will recommend a polymer to the user based on the conditions the will be subject to.

The user will be asked the following questions:

The user will first be asked if he/she has data on the specific conditions the polymer will be used. If so, then the user will be asked the following questions:
```
1. What is the maximum temperature the polymer will be exposed to?
2. What is the minimum temperature the polymer will be exposed to?
3. What is the maximum load the polymer will be exposed to?
4. What is the type of load the polymer will be exposed to? (Tension, compression, shear, torsion, or flexure)
5. What is the maximum time the polymer will be exposed to the load?
```

If the user does not have data on the specific conditions the polymer will be used, then the user will be asked the following questions:
```
1. What is the general application of the polymer? (Automotive, aerospace, medical, etc.)
2. In what country will the polymer be used?
```

The program will then recommend a polymer based on the user's answers.
